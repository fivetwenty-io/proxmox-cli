# Test Coverage Matrix

> **Generated file — do not edit by hand.** Regenerate with

> phase in `scripts/e2e_lib/lifecycle.py`, so it stays correct as commands and
> tests change.

This document maps every invocable leaf command to its automated test coverage
across the two live suites:

- **e2e** (`scripts/e2e`, `make test-e2e`) — a read-only, parallel happy-path
  sweep against a configured context. Mutating operations are never executed;
  they are recorded as deferred. The `pbs` and `pdm` trees are opt-in: each
  runs only when `--pbs-context`/`--pdm-context` (or
  `make test-e2e PBS_CONTEXT=…`/`PDM_CONTEXT=…`) names a configured
  `product: pbs`/`product: pdm` context whose server is reachable, so all of
  their leaves are prerequisite-gated (◑).

- **lifecycle / mutate** (`scripts/lifecycle`, `make test-lifecycle`, or
  `scripts/e2e --mutate`) — the destructive counterpart. It provisions an
  isolated SDN zone and resource pool, drives the mutating sub-commands on
  purpose-built throwaway resources, records each verb, and tears everything
  down.

A third tree, **negative** (`scripts/e2e_lib/trees/negative.py`), asserts the
CLI's error contract: bad input must fail cleanly (non-zero exit plus a useful
message). It never mutates, so it does not set a happy-path ✓; leaves whose
failure path it guards are tagged `error-contract checked` in the Notes column.

## Legend

- **e2e ✓** — exercised unconditionally by the read-only sweep on every run.

- **e2e ◑** — exercised by the sweep only when prerequisite inventory exists
  (a VM, user, vnet, …); otherwise skipped (a skip still passes, exit 0).

- **mutate ✓** — driven live by the mutate phase on a purpose-built resource.

- **mutate ·** — driven by the mutate phase but recorded as SKIP because the
  host/guest cannot complete it (the reason is recorded); not a CLI gap.

- **—** — not exercised by that suite (a mutating verb is `—` for e2e because
  the read sweep never mutates; a read verb is `—` for mutate).

- **Notes** — `live via mutate phase` (deferred in the sweep, driven by
  `--mutate`), `deferred — …` (intentionally not run live, with reason),
  `n/a — …` (interactive or host-daemon, no automated coverage by design),
  `help-only` (only the `--help` parse is checked), `error-contract checked`
  (the failure path is guarded by the negative tree), or **uncovered** (a
  genuine gap, listed in the appendix).

## Isolation contract

Every resource the lifecycle suite creates is shielded from other lab efforts
(see `scripts/e2e_lib/model.py`, the single source of truth):

- named or hostnamed with the `pmx-cli-` prefix,

- placed in the `pmx-cli` resource pool and tagged `pmx-cli`,

- attached to a dedicated `pmxcli` simple SDN zone and `pmxcli0` vnet on the
  `172.30.0.0/24` subnet, deliberately off the host management network.

Teardown runs in a `finally` block and is idempotent: a crashed prior run is
swept clean before the next provisions.

Leaf commands are counted from a walk of the built command tree (`pmx <tree> … --help`); each `create`/`delete` and `get`/`set` verb is its own leaf. Of **1227** leaves, **367** are exercised by at least one live suite, **229** are deferred from the live suites (irreversible, interactive, or environment-bound — covered by unit tests), **23** are n/a by design, and **608** are not yet exercised by either suite — see [Uncovered leaves](#uncovered-leaves).

## Running the suites

```bash
make test-e2e                  # all trees, read-only, against the `lab` context
make test-e2e TREES=qemu       # a subset
make test-e2e CONTEXT=prod     # a different configured context
make test-e2e PBS_CONTEXT=pbs-lab  # opt into the pbs tree (needs a `product: pbs` context)
make test-e2e PDM_CONTEXT=pdm-lab  # opt into the pdm tree (needs a `product: pdm` context)
scripts/e2e --list             # list trees and the isolation contract

make test-e2e-mutate           # read-only sweep + the destructive verb matrix
make test-lifecycle            # the destructive verb matrix only, against `lab`
scripts/e2e --mutate --vm-only # sweep + VM verb matrix (skip the container)
scripts/lifecycle --vm-only    # VM verb matrix only
scripts/lifecycle --ct-only    # container verb matrix only
```

Both suites skip gracefully (exit 0) when no context is configured; pass
`--strict` to fail instead. The mutate phase prints a per-guest coverage table
listing every verb it drove and its result.
