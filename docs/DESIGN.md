# pmx-cli Architecture

## Overview

`pmx` is a Cobra-based CLI that wraps the generated
[`proxmox-apiclient-go`](https://github.com/fivetwenty-io/proxmox-apiclient-go) v3
client. The binary entry point is `cmd/pmx/main.go`; all logic lives under
`internal/`.

## Package layout

```
cmd/pmx/           — binary entry point; calls cli.Execute()
internal/
  cli/             — Cobra root, persistent flags, dependency wiring
    context/       — pmx context / pmx ctx command group
    api/           — pmx api (raw request) and pmx auth command groups
    access/        — pmx pve access subtree
    cluster/       — pmx pve cluster subtree
    node/          — pmx pve node subtree
    qemu/          — pmx pve qemu subtree
    lxc/           — pmx pve lxc subtree
    sdn/           — pmx pve sdn subtree
    storage/       — pmx pve storage subtree
    pool/          — pmx pve pool subtree
    task/          — pmx pve task subtree
    version/       — pmx version subtree
    initcmd/       — pmx init subtree
    lab/           — pmx lab subtree: config-driven nested lab lifecycle
                     (create/destroy/list/status/start/stop/net/access/quota/config);
                     available only under the pmx persona, not pve/pbs/pdm
  apiclient/       — thin wrapper: service handles, UPID extraction, task-wait
  config/          — Config types, loader, atomic writer, secret resolver
  output/          — table/plain/json/yaml renderer
  logx/            — JSONL slog audit logger
  exec/            — shell-out runner (SSH, rsync)
  nodeaddr/        — node address resolution
```

## Contexts

A **context** is a named bundle of connection and authentication settings for
one Proxmox endpoint of a single product: Proxmox VE (PVE), Proxmox Backup Server
(PBS), or Proxmox Datacenter Manager (PDM). The config file at `~/.config/pmx/config.yml`
stores all contexts under the `contexts:` key.

```yaml
current-context: lab
previous-context: prod
contexts:
  lab:
    host: pve.example.com
    port: 8006
    protocol: https
    product: pve
    realm: pam
    default-node: pve1
    default-output: table
    auth:
      type: token
      username: root@pam
      token-id: automation
      secret: ${PMX_TOKEN}
    tls:
      insecure: false
      fingerprint: ""
      ca-cert: ""
  prod:
    host: pbs.example.com
    port: 8007
    product: pbs
    ...
```

Each context carries a `product:` field (`pve`, `pbs`, or `pdm`; empty means
`pve`). The default port follows the product: 8006 (PVE), 8007 (PBS), 8443
(PDM).

### Selection precedence

The active context is resolved in this order on every command invocation:

1. `--context/-c` flag (highest priority).
2. `$PMX_CONTEXT` environment variable.
3. `current-context:` in the config file.

If none of these resolves to a configured context, the command exits with
"no context specified" and suggests `pmx context select`.

### previous-context mechanism

`pmx context select <name>` writes the outgoing `current-context` into
`previous-context` before updating `current-context`. This allows:

- `pmx context previous` — swap back in one step.
- `pmx context select -` — the same swap via the `-` shorthand.

`previous-context` is cleared when a stale reference is detected (the named
context was removed); the error message guides the operator to run
`pmx context select <name>` again.

### Per-context defaults

Each context may carry `default-node` and `default-output` values. These
supply the defaults for `--node` and `--output` on every command run under
that context. The resolution order for both fields is:

1. Explicit flag (`--node` / `--output`).
2. Environment variable (`$PMX_NODE` / `$PMX_OUTPUT`).
3. Context `default-node` / `default-output`.
4. Built-in global default (`""` for node, `table` for output).

A value at a higher tier always wins. In particular, `$PMX_NODE` and
`$PMX_OUTPUT` outrank per-context defaults.

### Context validation

`pmx context validate [<name>] [--all]` runs structural checks against one or
all contexts without contacting any Proxmox API:

- `host` is present.
- `auth.type` is `token` or `password`; required sub-fields are set.
- `port`, if non-zero, is in `[1, 65535]`.
- `protocol`, if set, is `https` or `http`.
- `default-output`, if set, is one of `table`, `ascii`, `plain`, `json`, `yaml`.
- `fingerprint`, if set, matches the `XX:XX:…:XX` hex SHA-256 pattern (32 pairs).

Network connectivity is not checked in v1 (`--connect` is reserved for a future
release). Exit status is 0 when all validated contexts pass, 1 when any fail.

### Secret resolution

`auth.secret` is resolved through three tiers at connection time:

- `${VAR}` or `$VAR` — read from the environment; `${VAR}` errors if unset.
- `keychain:path` — read from the system keychain.
- Literal — used verbatim, with a one-time stderr warning.

Password login persists a live session (ticket + CSRF + expiry) back into the
context entry; `pmx auth logout` invalidates and removes it.

Known limitation for local development builds on macOS: keychain item ACLs bind
to the binary's signing identity, and an ad-hoc-signed local build gets a new
identity on every rebuild, so items stored by the previous build surface as
"item could not be found" to the next one. Installed, consistently-signed
binaries (the released Homebrew/pkg builds are Developer ID-signed) are
unaffected. Recovery is `pmx lab context sync <name>`, which rotates the token
and rewrites the keychain item; the store path purges every existing item for
the (service, account) pair before adding, so repeated recoveries never
accumulate duplicate entries.

## Dependency wiring

`internal/cli/root.go` registers a `PersistentPreRunE` hook that:

1. Loads the config file.
2. Resolves the active context name (flag → env → config).
3. Constructs a `*cli.Deps` value (config, context, output renderer, logger).
4. Stores it in the command's annotation map via `cli.SetDeps`.

Sub-commands retrieve deps with `cli.GetDeps(cmd)`. Commands annotated
`noClient: true` (all `pmx context` and `pmx auth` verbs) skip API-client
construction; they operate only on the local config file.

## Output rendering

Every command returns an `output.Result` value (headers + rows for tables,
`Raw` for JSON/YAML, `Message` for plain text). The renderer selected by
`--output/-o` (or `$PMX_OUTPUT`, or the context's `default-output`) formats
the result to stdout. JSON and YAML preserve native API types.

## Audit logging

All commands write a JSONL log under `~/.pmx/logs/`, nested by command path
(`pve/storage/volume/copy/{timestamp}.jsonl`) by default; `log.layout: flat`
in config.yml (or `PMX_LOG_LAYOUT=flat`) restores the flat
`{command}[-{subcommand}]-{timestamp}.jsonl` layout. Authorization, cookie,
CSRF, `password`, `token`, and `secret` fields are redacted before writing.
The minimum level defaults to `info` and is set with `log.level` or
`PMX_LOG_LEVEL`. Pass `--no-log` to suppress the log file; `--verbose`,
`--debug`, or `--trace` raise the slog level to debug.

Every file is a per-invocation audit trail: it opens with an `invocation`
record (command path, positional args with sensitive `key=value` pairs
masked, context name, CLI version) and closes with an `exit` record
(semantic exit code, duration; written at error level with the error text
on failure so it survives any configured `log.level`). The exit record is
written even when the failure happens before the command body runs (context
resolution or client construction). HTTP activity from the API client lands
between the two. No log file is ever empty.

Passthrough commands whose positional arguments are a foreign command line
— `pmx ssh`, `pmx rsync`, `pmx pve node ssh`/`exec`, `pmx pve qemu ssh`, and
`pmx pve qemu agent exec` — log only an argument count in place of the argv
(via the `passthroughArgs` annotation, or implicitly when a command sets
`DisableFlagParsing`), since a remote command can embed credentials in forms
no `key=value` scan recognises (for example `mysql -pSECRET`).

`pmx logs prune [--older-than <days>] [--empty] [--dry-run]` deletes aged
log files (cutoff from the flag or the `log.retention` config key), 0-byte
files older than one hour with `--empty`, and any directories the removals
empty out. A positive `log.retention` also runs the equivalent prune
automatically at most once per 24 hours after a command completes, gated by
the `~/.pmx/logs/.last-prune` sentinel's mtime.

## Asynchronous tasks

Commands that trigger PVE background tasks (VM/CT lifecycle, snapshots,
storage operations) block by default until the task reaches a terminal state,
then exit with the appropriate semantic exit code. Pass `--async` to return the
task UPID immediately instead.

## Semantic exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 1 | Generic error |
| 2 | Bad arguments |
| 3 | Infrastructure / connection error |
| 4 | Authentication failure |
| 5 | Not found |
| 6 | Conflict (resource locked) |
| 7 | Two-factor authentication required |
