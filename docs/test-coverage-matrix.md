# Test Coverage Matrix

> **Generated file — do not edit by hand.** Regenerate with
> `go build -o ./dist/pve ./cmd/pve && python3 scripts/coverage_matrix.py`.
> The classification is derived statically from the built command tree, the
> read-only sweep definitions in `scripts/e2e_lib/trees/*.py`, and the mutate
> phase in `scripts/e2e_lib/lifecycle.py`, so it stays correct as commands and
> tests change.

This document maps every invocable leaf command to its automated test coverage
across the two live suites:

- **e2e** (`scripts/e2e`, `make test-e2e`) — a read-only, parallel happy-path
  sweep against a configured target. Mutating operations are never executed;
  they are recorded as deferred.

- **lifecycle / mutate** (`scripts/lifecycle`, `make test-lifecycle`, or
  `scripts/e2e --mutate`) — the destructive counterpart. It provisions an
  isolated SDN zone and resource pool, drives the mutating sub-commands on
  purpose-built throwaway resources, records each verb, and tears everything
  down.

A third tree, **negative** (`scripts/e2e_lib/trees/negative.py`), asserts the
CLI's error contract: bad input must fail cleanly (non-zero exit plus a useful
message). It never mutates, so it does not set a happy-path ✓; leaves whose
failure path it guards are tagged `error-contract checked` in the Notes column.

## Legend

- **e2e ✓** — exercised unconditionally by the read-only sweep on every run.

- **e2e ◑** — exercised by the sweep only when prerequisite inventory exists
  (a VM, user, vnet, …); otherwise skipped (a skip still passes, exit 0).

- **mutate ✓** — driven live by the mutate phase on a purpose-built resource.

- **mutate ·** — driven by the mutate phase but recorded as SKIP because the
  host/guest cannot complete it (the reason is recorded); not a CLI gap.

- **—** — not exercised by that suite (a mutating verb is `—` for e2e because
  the read sweep never mutates; a read verb is `—` for mutate).

- **Notes** — `live via mutate phase` (deferred in the sweep, driven by
  `--mutate`), `deferred — …` (intentionally not run live, with reason),
  `n/a — …` (interactive or host-daemon, no automated coverage by design),
  `help-only` (only the `--help` parse is checked), `error-contract checked`
  (the failure path is guarded by the negative tree), or **uncovered** (a
  genuine gap, listed in the appendix).

## Isolation contract

Every resource the lifecycle suite creates is shielded from other lab efforts
(see `scripts/e2e_lib/model.py`, the single source of truth):

- named or hostnamed with the `pve-cli-` prefix,

- placed in the `pve-cli` resource pool and tagged `pve-cli`,

- attached to a dedicated `pvecli` simple SDN zone and `pvecli0` vnet on the
  `172.30.0.0/24` subnet, deliberately off the host management network.

Teardown runs in a `finally` block and is idempotent: a crashed prior run is
swept clean before the next provisions.

Leaf commands are counted from a walk of the built command tree (`pve <tree> … --help`); each `create`/`delete` and `get`/`set` verb is its own leaf. Of **556** leaves, **380** are exercised by at least one suite, **64** are deferred or n/a by design (irreversible, interactive, or environment-bound), and **112** are not yet exercised by either suite — see [Uncovered leaves](#uncovered-leaves).

## Uncovered leaves

Leaves exercised by neither suite. These are genuine coverage gaps — candidates for read-only sweep checks (the `get`/`list`/`show` verbs) or isolated mutate-phase coverage (the `create`/`set`/`delete` verbs). Each is listed inline per tree for a compact gap view.

**`access`** (3) — `access tfa create`, `access tfa delete`, `access tfa set`

**`cluster`** (33) — `cluster acme account delete`, `cluster acme account set`, `cluster config join add`, `cluster config nodes delete`, `cluster firewall alias update`, `cluster firewall group rule-update`, `cluster firewall rules update`, `cluster ha resource relocate`, `cluster ha status arm`, `cluster mapping pci delete`, `cluster mapping pci get`, `cluster mapping pci set`, `cluster mapping usb create`, `cluster mapping usb delete`, `cluster mapping usb get`, `cluster mapping usb set`, `cluster notifications matcher create`, `cluster notifications matcher delete`, `cluster notifications matcher get`, `cluster notifications matcher set`, `cluster notifications sendmail create`, `cluster notifications sendmail delete`, `cluster notifications sendmail get`, `cluster notifications sendmail set`, `cluster notifications smtp create`, `cluster notifications smtp delete`, `cluster notifications smtp get`, `cluster notifications smtp set`, `cluster notifications targets-test`, `cluster notifications webhook create`, `cluster notifications webhook delete`, `cluster notifications webhook get`, `cluster notifications webhook set`

**`pool`** (1) — `pool delete`

**`qemu`** (8) — `qemu agent exec`, `qemu agent exec-status`, `qemu agent file-read`, `qemu agent file-write`, `qemu agent set-user-password`, `qemu firewall alias update`, `qemu firewall rules update`, `qemu snapshot update`

**`sdn`** (31) — `sdn controller delete`, `sdn controller get`, `sdn controller set`, `sdn dns delete`, `sdn dns get`, `sdn dns set`, `sdn fabric delete`, `sdn fabric get`, `sdn fabric node create`, `sdn fabric node delete`, `sdn fabric node get`, `sdn fabric node set`, `sdn fabric set`, `sdn ipam set`, `sdn prefix-list delete`, `sdn prefix-list entry add`, `sdn prefix-list entry delete`, `sdn prefix-list entry get`, `sdn prefix-list entry list`, `sdn prefix-list entry set`, `sdn prefix-list get`, `sdn prefix-list set`, `sdn route-map entry delete`, `sdn route-map entry get`, `sdn route-map entry set`, `sdn route-map get`, `sdn subnet delete`, `sdn vnet delete`, `sdn vnet firewall options set`, `sdn vnet firewall rules set`, `sdn zone delete`

## Running the suites

```bash
make test-e2e                  # all trees, read-only, against the `lab` target
make test-e2e TREES=qemu       # a subset
make test-e2e TARGET=prod      # a different configured target
scripts/e2e --list             # list trees and the isolation contract

make test-e2e-mutate           # read-only sweep + the destructive verb matrix
make test-lifecycle            # the destructive verb matrix only, against `lab`
scripts/e2e --mutate --vm-only # sweep + VM verb matrix (skip the container)
scripts/lifecycle --vm-only    # VM verb matrix only
scripts/lifecycle --ct-only    # container verb matrix only
```

Both suites skip gracefully (exit 0) when the target is not configured; pass
`--strict` to fail instead. The mutate phase prints a per-guest coverage table
listing every verb it drove and its result.
